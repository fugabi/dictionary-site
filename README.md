dictionary-site
===============

A static dictionary site with client-side search.

## Overview

This site implements client-side search and browsing for the word and index
files generated by [convert-websters][convertWebsters].  Because it doesn't
require any code to execute on the server for search, it can be hosted on
Amazon S3 or similar.  And it feels pretty snappy.

The README for [convert-websters][convertWebsters] gives a description of my
inspiration for this project.

## Building

I use [Hammer for Mac][hammerForMac] to build the site, but it probably wouldn't
be too hard to adapt it to any kind of templating tool.
